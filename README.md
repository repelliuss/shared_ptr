## General Info
*rps::shared_ptr* is for educational purposes. It's syntax is mostly identical **prior to C++17**. This library doesn't support aliasing constructor, relations with other types of *rps::shared_ptr*s, relation with unique_ptr and relation with weak_ptr.

## Example
```cpp
using namespace rps;
shared_ptr<int> ptr(new int(7));
shared_ptr<int> array_ptr(new int[10], default_delete<int[]>());
```

## Features
* *rps::shared_ptr* directly uses 8-bit whereas std::shared_ptr uses 16-bit.
* Light-weight, so faster.
* Names are descriptive so it is easier to follow and learn.
* *rps::shared_ptr* uses same syntax as std::shared_ptr to use it quickly.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your project.
2. `#include <repelliuss/shared_ptr>` and you are good to go.
